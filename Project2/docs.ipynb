    "## 1. Progress Report (Student’s Voice)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **DICOM CT volume I/O with SimpleITK**  \n",
    "  I implemented `load_ct_volume` to read entire CT series from a folder using `sitk.ImageSeriesReader`. The function applies any Rescale Slope/Intercept metadata automatically, and prints out volume shape, spacing, slope, and intercept (e.g., `shape=(207,512,512), spacing=(0.78125,0.78125,2.5), slope=1.0, intercept=0.0` for the reference CT). \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Segmentation import & frame-to-slice mapping**  \n",
    "  I wrote `load_segmentation` to read a DICOM-RTSEG with SimpleITK, then used pydicom to extract `PerFrameFunctionalGroupsSequence` and map each frame’s physical Z-position to the corresponding CT slice index. It loaded 15 frames into a full 3D mask, printing each frame’s `z_phys` and `slice_index`. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dual‐CT dataset handling**  \n",
    "  The notebook loads two CT series—“10_AP_Ax2.50mm” as the reference and “30_EQP_Ax2.50mm” as the input—producing `ref_vol.shape=(207,512,512)` and `inp_vol.shape=(111,512,512)`. This sets up atlas‐based propagation of the segmentation. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Bounding‐box and centroid computation**  \n",
    "  Using NumPy’s `argwhere`, I computed the bounding box (`Z:[152,183] Y:[198,336] X:[72,306]`) and centroid index `(176,229,117)` of the reference mask to localize the ROI. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Seed‐point transform to input CT**  \n",
    "  I transformed the reference centroid’s physical coordinates `(-121.59375, 69.90625, -57.5)` into the input CT index space, yielding a seed index of `(z,y,x)=(71,229,127)` for region growing. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **3D region‐growing segmentation**  \n",
    "  Defined `RegionGrowing3D` to flood‐fill voxels within intensity bounds (−50 to 150 HU) starting from the seed, restricted to a padded bounding box (±5 voxels). Produced a raw mask (`auto_raw`). \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Post‐processing of raw mask**  \n",
    "  Applied `binary_fill_holes` and labeled connected components, removing all components smaller than 500 voxels. (A warning about overflow in voxel‐count subtraction indicates I need to fix the subtraction logic.) \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Quantitative evaluation metrics**  \n",
    "  Resampled the ground-truth segmentation onto the input CT grid with nearest‐neighbor interpolation, then computed Dice (0.0015), Jaccard (0.0010), and volume difference (7032.59 cm³) using `EvalMetrics`. These very low overlap scores and huge volume discrepancy highlight that the region growing parameters or seed placement need refinement. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Slice‐by‐slice overlay visualization**  \n",
    "  Overlaid GT contours in green and auto‐segmentation contours in red on three slices around the volume midpoint (mid ± 10). The overlays clearly show almost no overlap, underscoring the need for improved segmentation strategy. \n",

    "## 2. Student’s Open Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Rescale slope/intercept reliability**  \n",
    "   I hard-coded reading of DICOM tags `0028|1053` and `0028|1052`. How should I handle cases where slope/intercept are missing or stored differently?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Frame-to-slice mapping edge cases**  \n",
    "   My mapping relies on exact Z-position matching with `np.isclose`. What tolerance should I use, and how to handle cases where no slice matches due to rounding or different coordinate origins?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Overflow in post-processing subtraction**  \n",
    "   I saw `RuntimeWarning: overflow encountered in scalar subtract` when computing removed voxels. How do I correctly compute and log the number of voxels removed without overflow?\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Region growing within ROI bounding box**  \n",
    "   I passed an `roi` tuple to `RegionGrowing3D` but never used it in `segment()`. Should I crop the volume to the ROI first or add boundary checks to limit the search?\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Parameter selection for region growing**  \n",
    "   Intensity bounds (−50 to 150 HU) were chosen arbitrarily. What’s a recommended workflow to tune these thresholds (e.g., histogram analysis, interactive tools)?\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Resampling GT to input grid**  \n",
    "   Is nearest-neighbor interpolation sufficient for binary masks, or should I use distance‐based or smoother interpolators to better align geometries?\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Interpreting low Dice/Jaccard**  \n",
    "   I got Dice = 0.0015 and volume difference > 7000 cm³. Does this always imply a bad segmentation, or could coordinate misalignment be the culprit? How to isolate the source of error?\n",
