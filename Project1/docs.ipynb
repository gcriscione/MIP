    "## 1. Progress Report (Student’s Voice)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **DICOM CT loading & header parsing**  \n",
    "  “I successfully loaded 207 DICOM slices in about 0.4 s, with voxel spacing (0.78125, 0.78125, 2.5 mm). The missing `AcquisitionNumber` tags triggered warnings—so far it doesn’t break anything, but I should consider a fallback (e.g., `InstanceNumber`) if I use acquisition numbers downstream.”\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Multi-ROI segmentation import & validation**  \n",
    "  “The segmentation loader found only segment 1 (20 347 voxels) and flagged segments 2–4 as missing. I need to double-check my DICOM-RTSTRUCT input or update the loader to gracefully handle partial ROI sets.”\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Slice overlay visualization**  \n",
    "  “Overlay for slice 23 looks good: CT in grayscale, tumor mask in semi-transparent jet, and green contours outline the ROI precisely. Saved as `slice_overlay_23.png`. I might want to try a single colormap plus contour color to reduce potential color-map bias.”\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Maximum Intensity Projections (MIPs)**  \n",
    "  “Computed coronal and sagittal MIPs in ~0.1 s and saved `mips_combined.png`. The tumor silhouette is clear, but I wonder if I should apply CT windowing (e.g., soft-tissue window) before projection to improve contrast.”\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Rotating 3D GIF animation**  \n",
    "  “Generated an 18-frame rotation GIF at 10 fps in ~0.04 s; file size is ~2 MB. It’s visually effective, but perhaps exporting as MP4 or increasing frame count (e.g., 36 frames) would give smoother rotation without bloating file size.”\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Performance benchmarking & logging**  \n",
    "  “All timing and memory metrics (CT load, segmentation load, MIP compute, GIF creation; memory peaks ~473 MB) were logged to `performance_metrics.csv`. Next, I could plot these metrics to quickly identify any bottlenecks.”\n",

    "## 2. Student’s Open Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Missing DICOM tags**  \n",
    "   - Why might `AcquisitionNumber` be missing in my CT series? Should I fallback to another tag (e.g. `InstanceNumber`), or is it better to require a consistent tag for production code?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Partial ROI segments**  \n",
    "   - Only segment 1 was loaded; segments 2–4 are missing. Is this a dataset issue or should I modify `load_segmentation` to handle multiple segment sets differently?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Isotropic resampling**  \n",
    "   - Given anisotropic voxel spacing (2.5 mm slice thickness), should I resample to isotropic voxels for more accurate MIP and 3D rotations?\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Visualization performance**  \n",
    "   - On large volumes, per-frame rotation + MIP is slow. Are there GPU-accelerated or vectorized libraries (e.g., VTK, napari, OpenGL) I could use to improve interactivity?\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Reproducible environment**  \n",
    "   - Do I need to capture exact library versions (via `pip freeze` or `environment.yml`) and seed any random operations to guarantee that anyone rerunning this notebook gets identical results?\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Advanced profiling**  \n",
    "   - Would integrating `cProfile`, `line_profiler`, or `pytest-benchmark` give me finer-grained insights than the current manual timing/logging approach?\n",
